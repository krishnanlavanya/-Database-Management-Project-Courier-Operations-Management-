## Overview

The goal of **Couriers** is to help a hypothetical **delivery company** manage their operations by utilizing an **SQL database**. The database facilitates the storing and managing of **orders** and all of the information associated with that.

All in all, the database has 7 tables - `Clients`, `Couriers`, `Dispatchers`, `Recipients`, `Addresses` and `TypesOfService`, which are each connected to the final table, called `Orders`. The database includes procedures that can **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** (**CRUD**[^crud]) data from any of the aformentioned tables.

## Setup

*A prerequisite to using the database and its feature is actually setting it up. This section will explain how to do just that.*

### Obtain the Necessary Files

Depending on whether you want to simply generate the database and use its features or develop the database and its features further, you can go one of two ways:

1. Download the `couriers.sql` and `examples.sql` files from the [The Latest Release](https://github.com/vesk4000/Couriers/releases/latest) if you simply want to use the database and its features.
2. Clone or download this repository (click on the green `Code` button at the top of this page) if you are interested in the entire source code as it is organized for development.

### Compile the SQL Files

> **Note:** If you chose to just download the SQL files from the [The Latest Release](https://github.com/vesk4000/Couriers/releases/latest) as the 1st method stated you can skip this step.

Run the `compile.bat` file. If you don't yet have the compiler executable `sql-compiler/sql-compiler.exe` it will automatically download it from [The Latest Release](https://github.com/vesk4000/Couriers/releases/latest). Once you have the executable it will be ran and you should see two new files generated in the root directory of the project - `couriers.sql` and `examples.sql`.

Alternatively, you can run the `sql-compiler/sql-compiler.exe` executable with certain arguments. You can find arguments that are used to execute the executable in the `compile.bat` file. You can of course edit the file edit the `.bat` file or create your own in order to make the compiler suit your needs.

> **Note:** You can find much more about compiling the SQL files in the [Project Structure section](#project-structure).

> **Note:** If you are not using a Windows environment you can of course compile the SQL Compiler yourself, though this has not been tested by us and we cannot guarantee that would work perfectly.

### Generate the Database

To generate the database and all of its components by simply executing the `couriers.sql` file all at once on a Microsoft SQL Server.

> **Note:** The `examples.sql` file is optional. All it includes are examples for the various functions and procedures that the database has.

## Usage

*Now that you have the database up and running this section will showcase all of the different features that the database has and how to use them.*

### Add

Add an entry into any of the tables in the database using one of the seven `Add` procedures (`udp_AddAddress`, `udp_AddCourier`, `udp_AddRecipient`, `udp_AddDispatcher`, `udp_AddClient`, `udp_AddTypeOfService`, `udp_AddOrder`). Each of them have different parameters depending on the table. You might get an error message if you try to create an entry which already exists in the specific table or if you pass invalid parameters to the procedure. If successful, the procedure will print out the `ID` of the newly created entry.

**Syntax**

```sql
exec udp_AddAddress @Address nvarchar
exec udp_AddCourier @Name nvarchar, @PhoneNumber nvarchar
exec udp_AddDispatcher @Name nvarchar, @PhoneNumber nvarchar
exec udp_AddClient @Name nvarchar, @PhoneNumber nvarchar
exec udp_AddRecipient @Name nvarchar
exec udp_AddTypeOfService @Type nvarchar
exec udp_AddOrder @OrderDate Date, @ReceiveDate Date, @Total int, @AddressID int, @CourierID int, @DispatcherID int, @ClientID int, @RecipientID int, @TypeID int
```

**Examples**

```sql
exec udp_AddClient 'Tom Scott', '0888888888';
exec udp_AddClient 'John Doe', 'not a phone number';
exec udp_AddClient 'Tom Scott', '0888888888';
exec udp_AddOrder '01-25-2022', '01-30-2022', 5000, 5, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3
```

### Update

Update an entry from any of the tables in the database using one of the seven `Update` procedures (`udp_UpdateAddress`, `udp_UpdateCourier`, `udp_UpdateRecipient`, `udp_UpdateDispatcher`, `udp_UpdateClient`, `udp_UpdateTypeOfService`, `udp_UpdateOrder`). All you have to do is pass on the `ID` of the entry that you are trying to update and the values that you want to update. If you leave any of the parameters `NULL`, those values will simply not be updated. If you enter an invalid `ID` or any other invalid value, you may receive an error message.

**Syntax**

```sql
exec udp_UpdateAddress @ID int, @Address nvarchar = NULL
exec udp_UpdateCourier @ID int, @Name nvarchar = NULL, @PhoneNumber nvarchar = NULL
exec udp_UpdateDispatcher @ID int, @Name nvarchar = NULL, @PhoneNumber nvarchar = NULL
exec udp_UpdateClient @ID int, @Name nvarchar = NULL, @PhoneNumber nvarchar = NULL
exec udp_UpdateRecipient @ID int, @Name nvarchar = NULL
exec udp_UpdateTypeOfService @ID int, @Type nvarchar = NULL
exec udp_UpdateOrder @ID int, @OrderDate Date = NULL, @ReceiveDate Date = NULL, @Total int = NULL, @AddressID int = NULL, @CourierID int = NULL, @DispatcherID int = NULL, @ClientID int = NULL, @RecipientID int = NULL, @TypeID int = NULL
```

**Examples**

```sql
exec udp_UpdateClient 5, 'Tom', '089899898'
exec udp_UpdateClient 5, 'Don'
exec udp_UpdateClient 5, NULL, '798797898'
exec udp_UpdateClient 5, @PhoneNumber = '456465456'
exec udp_UpdateClient 1000
exec udp_UpdateOrder 3, @ReceiveDate = '01-31-2022', @TypeID = 2
```

### Delete (Parent Tables)

`CouriersDB` has 6 parent tables (`dbo.Clients`, `dbo.Dispatchers`, `dbo.Couriers`, `dbo.Recipients`, `dbo.Addresses`, and `dbo.TypesOfService`).

> **Note:** The following examples are part of the **delete procedure** `dbo.delete_couriers`. Given that all delete procedures for the parent tables almost completely overlap, it is unnecessary to show all 6 of them here.

For each one of those parent tables there is a **delete procedure** (`dbo.delete_couriers`, `dbo.delete_clients`, `dbo.delete_dispatchers`, `dbo.delete_recipients`, `dbo.delete_addresses`, `dbo.delete_types`) which deletes the records from a specific **parent table** by a given `OldID` (unless `OldID` is invalid, which is a case discussed below).

In addition to the deletion mentioned above and based on the entered parameters, the type-1 delete procedures can be executed in 5 different ways.

**1. If the user enters an invalid `OldID`**

In this case, the procedure will `PRINT` a message which says: 'No such [some object] exists', and the procedure will exit without making any alterations to any of the tables of `CouriersDB`

```sql
EXEC dbo.delete_couriers OldID;
```

**Example:**

```sql
EXEC dbo.delete_couriers -1;
```

**2. If the user enters only a valid `OldID`**

In this case, the procedure will `DELETE` the records from `dbo.Orders` where the `FOREIGN KEY` (`courierID` in the given example), which is linked to a specific table, is equal to `OldID`

```sql
EXEC dbo.delete_couriers OldID;
```

**Example:**

```sql
EXEC dbo.delete_couriers 1;
```

**3. If the user enters `OldID` and `WantToDeleteFromOrders = 0`**

> **Note:** `WantToDeleteFromOrders` is a `BIT` parameter, which indicates whether the user wants to `DELETE` some of the records from `dbo.Orders` (like in the example above) **OR** `UPDATE` `dbo.Orders` by setting a new value to the `FOREIGN KEY` (`courierID` in the given example), which is linked to a specific table. `WantToDeleteFromOrders` is set to 1 (`DELETE`) by default. Also, if the user executes the delete procedure by setting the `WantToDeleteFromOrders` = 1, it will be executed in the same way as in 1. or 2. (depending on the validity of `OldID`).

In this case, the procedure will `UPDATE` the records from `dbo.Orders` where the `FOREIGN KEY` (`courierID` in the given example), which is linked to a specific table, is equal to `OldID` and set that `FOREIGN KEY` to `NULL`

```sql
EXEC dbo.delete_couriers OldID, WantToDeleteFromOrders;
```

**Example:**

```sql
EXEC dbo.delete_couriers 2, 0;
```

**4. If the user enters `OldID`, `WantToDeleteFromOrders`, and a valid `NewID`**

> **Note:** `NewID` is the `ID` which the new value of the `FOREIGN KEY` (`courierID` in the given example) is set to. `NewID` is `NULL` by default. `NewID` is considered valid when a specific parent table (`dbo.Couriers` in the given example) which has `ID` equal to `NewID`. In all other cases `NewID` is invalid.

In this case, the procedure will `UPDATE` the records from `dbo.Orders` where the `FOREIGN KEY` (`courierID` in the given example), which is linked to a specific table, is equal to `OldID` and set that `FOREIGN KEY` to `NewID`

```sql
EXEC dbo.delete_couriers OldID, WantToDeleteFromOrders, NewID;
```

**Example:**

```sql
EXEC dbo.delete_couriers 3, 0, 4;
```

**5. If the user enters `@OldID`, `@WantToDeleteFromOrders`, and an invalid `@NewID`**

In this case, the procedure will `UPDATE` the records from `dbo.Orders` where the `FOREIGN KEY` (`courierID` in the given example) that is linked to a specific table is equal to `@OldID` and set that `FOREIGN KEY` to `NULL`

```sql
EXEC dbo.delete_couriers OldID, WantToDeleteFromOrders, NewID;
```

**Example:**

```sql
EXEC dbo.delete_couriers 3, 0, 4;
```

### Delete (`dbo.Orders`)

The delete procedure `dbo.delete_orders` deletes a record from `dbo.Orders` by a given `OldID` (unless the given `OldID` is invalid; in this case, the procedure will `PRINT` a 'No such order exists' message and exit without making any alterations to `dbo.Orders`)

```sql
EXEC dbo.delete_orders OldID;
```

**Example:**

```sql
EXEC dbo.delete_orders 1;
```

## Project Structure

*This is an in-depth look into how the project/repository is structured. In the process of development we made some pretty unique decisions and build a tool to help us develop the database better, so we think this section might be helpful for people wishing to do a similair project or even fork this one.*

In order to facilitate for easier collaboration and overall code development, we split up all of the SQL code into many files. All of them are located in the `source` folder in the root of the repository. In there you will find the files grouped into the `crud-procedures`, `data`, `private`, `queries` and `schemas` folders. All of those folders contain a number of `.sql` files, which themselves are all either a definition of a single procedure, function, table or database, or in the case of the files in the `data` folder - the `INSERT` queries used to populate the different tables with their respective data.

Here's a brief description of what each of the folders contain:
| Folder | Contains |
|:---:|---|
| `source/crud‑procedures` | CRUD procedures, except for the Read part, so basically different procedures for every table, which can each `Add`, `Update` or `Delete` any data within that table |
| `source/data` | SQL queries which insert the original data from the Excel table (`couriers‑project_data.xlsx`) into the different tables of the database |
| `source/private` | Procedures and functions which are not meant to be used by the end user, but rather by other procedures and functions in the database |
| `source/queries` | Various procedures which read certain data from the database and display it to the user in different ways |
| `source/schemas` | SQL queries which create each of the tables in the database and the database itself |

The `couriers‑project_data.xlsx` Excel file, which is contained in the root directory of the repo, includes all of the original data for the database.

> **Note:** The file is there only for completeness purposes. Changing it does not change the data in the database or what data the `.sql` files in the `source/data` folder insert into the database when executed. All of that data is hardcoded in those files.

The folder `sql-compiler` contains the source code and executable for a small SQL "compiler", written in C#. All it does is it takes all of the SQL files (in a certain order) and it combines them into a single SQL file. This makes it easy for both the developers and the end-user to execute all of the files at once and immediately have the database up and running, while at the same time allowing for the separation of the SQL code, which as we mentioned earlier facilities for more efficient development and code cleanliness. Another thing that the compiler does is that it creates a single file with all of the examples for each SQL file, which contains such examples. This makes it much easier for the end user to get to grips with the various things that they can do with the database, while also making it easier for developers to write examples as it allows them to do so within the actual file that they are working on at the moment.

To prevent clutter, the actual C# project for the compiler isn't a part of a Visual Studio Solution File (`.sln`) as it was created with the `dotnet` CLI tool which only requires a C# Project File (`sql-compiler.csproj`) and a C# Source File (`Program.cs`). The `sql-compiler.exe` is not included in the repository (it's ignored as per the `.gitignore` file of the repo). It can be downloaded from [The Latest Release](https://github.com/vesk4000/Couriers/releases/latest) (it is also automatically downloaded from there when `compile.bat` is ran, if it doesn't exist locally). It is a completely standalone executable that doesn't require the .NET runtime to work as it was created with the very useful .NET tool called [`dotnet-warp`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-warp).

To actually use the compiler you can pass arguments to it, but you can simply run the `compile.bat` file which as we mentioned will download the compiler executable if it doesn't exist locally and it will run the compiler with some default arguments. You can configure those arguments within the file and also you can configure which SQL files are compiled and in what order that is done, as that may be important depending on the files (e.g. you'd want the tables to be created, before you create the database). That particular thing is actually not passed to the compiler as an argument, but rather the `compile.bat` file passes itself as an argument and the compiler reads a comment within the `.bat` file which contains the names and relative paths of the files which are to be compiled (you can also use glob style wildcards such as `*` and `**`, just like in a `.gitignore` file thanks to the very useful .NET NuGet package [`Glob`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Glob/1.2.0-alpha0037)).

By default, the compiler generates 2 SQL files with the names `couriers.sql` and `example.sql` in the root directory of the repository. However, they are included in the `.gitignore` of the repo as to not cause any merge conflicts. The `couriers.sql` contains all of the code from all of the `.sql` files in the `source` directory. You can run the whole file at once to generate the whole database with all of its tables, data and features. The `examlpes.sql` is just a file with examples to all of the different features of the database.

## Database Design

*The database is not all that complicated, but it is important to understand it, if you want to understand the project and our development of it better.*

We designed the schema of our database `CouriersDB` by transforming a table in 1NF[^1nf] into 7 tables that meet the 3NF[^3nf] standards.

This is the given 1FN table with some sample data:

| Order # | Order Date | Dispatcher Name | Phone Number - Dispatcher | Client Name | Phone Number - Client | Type of Service | Total | Courier Name | Phone Number - Courier | Delivery Address | Recipient Name | Delivery Date |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 1                | 8/16/2021       | Асен Донев       | 0887897555         | Галин Христов  | 0888555111       | Колетна пратка над 2 до 5 кг | 6.72 лв. | Димана Донева | 0876555555       | ул. Бреза 9               | Галена Халиева   | 20.8.2021 г.     |
| 2                | 9/9/2021        | Асен Донев       | 0887897555         | Джим Шон       | 0888555222       | Колетна пратка до 2 кг       | 6.00 лв. | Камен Каменов | 0876555111       | ул. Александър Кръстев 22 | Шон Джим         | 15.9.2021 г.     |
| 3                | 9/9/2021        | Колю Колев       | 0888987555         | Джим Шон       | 0888555222       | Колетна пратка над 2 до 5 кг | 6.72 лв. | Мони Иванова  | 0876555222       | ул. Вардар 8              | Шон Джим         | 15.9.2021 г.     |

## Development

*In this section you can learn more about the development process (work principles of the procedures, problems we encountered while writing the queries, etc.).*

### Designing the Database

The initial design of the table was done by a using a DB designer tool (https://www.dbdesigner.net/). Om that platform the tables have been created and the relations and the other constraints have been set. Then, a MSSQL code was generated and exported.

>**Note:** We have altered the design of the table a bit after their initial creation mentioned above. We have added several `UNIQUE`, `IDENTITY`, and `NOT NULL` constraints. We also refactored the schema code so that it was a bit more human readable.

### Populating `CouriersDB`

To populate the database we used **SQLizer**, an online tool which generates SQL code from an Excel spreadsheet. At first it was somewhat annoying to use but once we understood how to use it work flowed smoothly.

In order to populate `CouriersDB` we had to split the data from the initial 1NF table into several small ones. Then, as we said, in order to `INSERT` the data into the **database** we used **SQLizer**, which transforms `.xlsx/.xls` tables sheets into `INSERT INTO` statements.

>**Note:** Due to the fact that **SQLizer** had issues converting .xls sheets into MSSQL statements, we had to convert them into MySQL ones and then alter the code in order to be usable in our MSSQL database.

After the export of those `INSERT INTO` statements we had to insert that data into our tables, but due to the necessity of formating that data we had to `CREATE` temporary tables, `INSERT` the mentioned above data into them and then reinsert that data with some minor changes into the specific tables (`dbo.Orders`, `dbo.Clients`, `dbo.Dispatchers`, `dbo.Couriers`, `dbo.Recipients`, `dbo.Addresses`, and `dbo.TypesOfService`).

### Git

In hindsight using Git was definitely not a time save. But considering that Git is and will be the Source Version Control industry standard for the foreseeable future it was definitely beneficial for us to learn it right now on a project where it matters much less if we screw something up. Overall, we did manage to get to grips with many of Git's features, although of course we still have lots to learn.

### SQL Compiler

Originally I thought that I'd just make the compiler as a Windows Batch File (`*.bat`). Once I started though I realized just how much of a hacky language that was and honestly it was practically impossible to work with, considering that it is not really much of a language. So I, in my opinion correctly, decided to make a small C# program that would do the job of a compiler. Unfortunately that meant that we had to include an binary executable in the repository which is never ideal, but it was our best option, since we didn't have a good environment for compiling C# code on all machines. This was also the reason that I made the executable completely standalone from the .NET framework.

### Add Procedures

The procedures which add entries in the various tables of the database are pretty simple. For most of the tables all we check for are whether the entry already exists and for the ones that have a phone number we check if the phone number if valid. For the procedure which adds entries into the `Orders` table we check if the IDs which were provided exist in the respective tables.

```sql
create or alter proc udp_AddClient
	@Name nvarchar(50),
	@PhoneNumber nvarchar(50)
as begin
	if exists(
		select * from Clients
		where Name = @Name and PhoneNumber = @PhoneNumber
	)
	begin
		print 'A client with the same name and phone number already exists!'
		return
	end
	if dbo._udf_CheckPhoneNumber(@PhoneNumber) = 0 begin
		print 'The phone number provided is not valid!'
		return
	end
	insert into Clients values (@Name, @PhoneNumber);
	declare @id int = (
		select top 1 ID from Clients
		where Name = @Name and PhoneNumber = @PhoneNumber)
	print 'Client added with ID: ' + cast(@id as nvarchar(50))
end
go
```

```sql
create or alter proc udp_AddOrder
	@OrderDate Date,
	@ReceiveDate Date,
	@Total money,
	@AddressID int,
	@TypeID int,
	@DispatcherID int,
	@ClientID int,
	@CourierID int,
	@RecipientID int
as begin
	if not exists(
		select * from Addresses
		where ID = @AddressID
	) begin
		print 'Invalid Address ID!'
		return
	end

	if not exists(
		select * from TypesOfService
		where ID = @TypeID
	) begin
		print 'Invalid Type ID!'
		return
	end

	if not exists(
		select * from Dispatchers
		where ID = @DispatcherID
	) begin
		print 'Invalid Dispatcher ID!'
		return
	end

	if not exists(
		select * from Clients
		where ID = @ClientID
	) begin
		print 'Invalid Client ID!'
		return
	end
	
	if not exists(
		select * from Couriers
		where ID = @CourierID
	) begin
		print 'Invalid Courier ID!'
		return
	end

	if not exists(
		select * from Recipients
		where ID = @RecipientID
	) begin
		print 'Invalid Recipient ID!'
		return
	end

	if exists(
		select * from Orders
		where OrderDate = @OrderDate
		and ReceiveDate = @ReceiveDate
		and Total = @Total
		and AddressID = @AddressID
		and TypeID = @TypeID
		and DispatcherID = @DispatcherID
		and ClientID = @ClientID
		and CourierID = @CourierID
		and RecipientID = @RecipientID
	) begin
		print 'This order is already in the database!'
		return
	end

	insert into Orders values (
		@OrderDate,
		@ReceiveDate,
		@Total,
		@AddressID,
		@TypeID,
		@DispatcherID,
		@ClientID,
		@CourierID,
		@RecipientID);
	declare @id int = (
		select top 1 ID from Orders
		where OrderDate = @OrderDate
		and ReceiveDate = @ReceiveDate
		and Total = @Total
		and AddressID = @AddressID
		and TypeID = @TypeID
		and DispatcherID = @DispatcherID
		and ClientID = @ClientID
		and CourierID = @CourierID
		and RecipientID = @RecipientID)
	print 'Order added with ID: ' + cast(@id as nvarchar(50))
end
go
```

### Update Procedures

The procedures which update entries in the various tables of the database are also quite simple. For all of the tables we of course check if the entry with the given `ID` exists. The we check each parameter and if it's not `NULL` we update the respective value of the given entry with that parameter.

```sql
create or alter proc udp_UpdateClient
	@ID int,
	@Name nvarchar(50) = NULL,
	@PhoneNumber nvarchar(50) = NULL
as begin
	if not exists (
		select * from Clients
		where ID = @ID
	)
	begin
		print 'No client with this ID exists!'
		return
	end

	if @Name is not NULL
	begin
		update Clients
		set Name = @Name
		where ID = @ID
	end

	if @PhoneNumber is not NULL
	begin
		update Clients
		set PhoneNumber = @PhoneNumber
		where ID = @ID
	end

	print 'Client updated!'
end
go
```

### Queries

#### 1. dbo.usp_CheckClientPartOfNameOrPhone
```sql
create or alter procedure usp_CheckClientPartOfNameOrPhone( @input nvarchar(50) )
as
begin

	if( dbo._udf_CheckPhoneNumber(@input) = 1 )
	begin
		select Name as [Client Name], PhoneNumber as [Phone Number] from Clients
		where CHARINDEX(@input, PhoneNumber) > 0
		return
	end

	select Name as [Client Name], PhoneNumber as [Phone Number] from Clients
	where CHARINDEX(@input, Name) > 0
	return

end
```

This procedure uses the predefined function `dbo._udf_CheckPhoneNumber` which checks if the input string is a valid phone number. Then a `SELECT` statement displays the output.

#### 2. dbo.usp_CheckByDispNameOrDateOfDelivery
```sql
create or alter procedure usp_CheckByDispNameOrDateOfDelivery( @input nvarchar(50) )
as
begin

	if( ISDATE(@input) = 1 )
	begin
		select 
			o.ID as [Order ID],
			o.OrderDate as [Order Date],
			d.Name as [Dispatcher Name], 
			d.PhoneNumber as [Dispatcher Phone], 
			cl.Name as [Client Name], 
			cl.PhoneNumber as [Client Phone], 
			t.Type as [Type of Service], 
			o.Total as [Total], 
			co.Name as [Courier Name], 
			co.PhoneNumber as [Courier Phone], 
			a.Address as [Delivery Address],
			r.Name as [Recipient Name],
			o.ReceiveDate as [Date of Delivery]

		from Orders as o

		inner join Addresses as a
		on o.AddressID = a.ID

		inner join Clients as cl
		on o.ClientID = cl.ID

		inner join Couriers as co
		on o.CourierID = co.ID

		inner join Dispatchers as d
		on o.DispatcherID = d.ID

		inner join Recipients as r
		on o.RecipientID = r.ID

		inner join TypesOfService as t
		on o.TypeID = t.ID

		where CAST( @input as date ) = o.ReceiveDate
		return
	end

	else
	begin
		select 
			o.ID as [Order ID],
			o.OrderDate as [Order Date],
			d.Name as [Dispatcher Name], 
			d.PhoneNumber as [Dispatcher Phone], 
			cl.Name as [Client Name], 
			cl.PhoneNumber as [Client Phone], 
			t.Type as [Type of Service], 
			o.Total as [Total], 
			co.Name as [Courier Name], 
			co.PhoneNumber as [Courier Phone], 
			a.Address as [Delivery Address],
			r.Name as [Recipient Name],
			o.ReceiveDate as [Date of Delivery]

		from Orders as o

		inner join Addresses as a
		on o.AddressID = a.ID

		inner join Clients as cl
		on o.ClientID = cl.ID

		inner join Couriers as co
		on o.CourierID = co.ID

		inner join Dispatchers as d
		on o.DispatcherID = d.ID

		inner join Recipients as r
		on o.RecipientID = r.ID

		inner join TypesOfService as t
		on o.TypeID = t.ID

		where @input = d.Name

		return
	end

end
```

This procedure checks if the input is a date to determine which mode it should use. Then a `SELECT` statement displays the output using mass `INNER JOIN`.

#### 3. dbo.usp_TotalOfOrdersByClient
```sql
create or alter procedure usp_TotalOfOrdersByClient( @input nvarchar(50) )
as
begin

	select SUM(o.Total) as 'Total by client' from Clients as c

	inner join Orders as o
	on c.ID = o.ClientID

	where @input = c.Name

end
```

This procedure uses a simple `SELECT` statement to display the output.

#### 4. dbo.usp_OrdersByDateOfOrder
```sql
create or alter procedure usp_OrdersByDateOfOrder( @input nvarchar(50) )
as
begin

	if( ISDATE(@input) = 1 )
	begin
		select o.ID as [Order ID],
		o.OrderDate as [Order Date],
		d.Name as [Dispatcher Name], 
		d.PhoneNumber as [Dispatcher Phone], 
		cl.Name as [Client Name], 
		cl.PhoneNumber as [Client Phone], 
		t.Type as [Type of Service], 
		o.Total as [Total], 
		co.Name as [Courier Name], 
		co.PhoneNumber as [Courier Phone], 
		a.Address as [Delivery Address],
		r.Name as [Recipient Name],
		o.ReceiveDate as [Date of Delivery]

		from Orders as o

		inner join Addresses as a
		on o.AddressID = a.ID

		inner join Clients as cl
		on o.ClientID = cl.ID

		inner join Couriers as co
		on o.CourierID = co.ID

		inner join Dispatchers as d
		on o.DispatcherID = d.ID

		inner join Recipients as r
		on o.RecipientID = r.ID

		inner join TypesOfService as t
		on o.TypeID = t.ID

		where CAST( @input as date ) = o.OrderDate
		return
	end

end
```

This procedure checks if the input is a valid date then uses a `SELECT` statement to display the output using mass `INNER JOIN`.

#### 5. dbo.usp_PackagesByCourier
```sql
create or alter procedure usp_PackagesByCourier( @input nvarchar(50) )
as
begin

	select 
		o.ID as [Order ID],
		o.OrderDate as [Order Date],
		d.Name as [Dispatcher Name], 
		d.PhoneNumber as [Dispatcher Phone], 
		cl.Name as [Client Name], 
		cl.PhoneNumber as [Client Phone], 
		t.Type as [Type of Service], 
		o.Total as [Total], 
		co.Name as [Courier Name], 
		co.PhoneNumber as [Courier Phone], 
		a.Address as [Delivery Address],
		r.Name as [Recipient Name],
		o.ReceiveDate as [Date of Delivery]

	from Orders as o

	inner join Addresses as a
	on o.AddressID = a.ID

	inner join Clients as cl
	on o.ClientID = cl.ID

	inner join Couriers as co
	on o.CourierID = co.ID

	inner join Dispatchers as d
	on o.DispatcherID = d.ID

	inner join Recipients as r
	on o.RecipientID = r.ID

	inner join TypesOfService as t
	on o.TypeID = t.ID

	where @input = co.Name

end
```

This procedure uses a `SELECT` statement to display the output using mass `INNER JOIN`.

#### 6. dbo.usp_dates_with_most_delivered_orders
```sql
CREATE OR ALTER Proc usp_dates_with_most_delivered_orders
AS
BEGIN
	SELECT COUNT(*) AS [count]
	INTO TempOrders
	FROM Orders
	GROUP BY ReceiveDate;

	SELECT ReceiveDate, COUNT(*) as [Count of delivered orders]
	FROM Orders AS o1
	GROUP BY ReceiveDate
	HAVING COUNT(*) >= ALL (
		SELECT [count]
		FROM TempOrders);
END
```

The first `SELECT` statement inside `usp_dates_with_most_delivered_orders` creates a temporary table (`dbo.TempOrders`) and inserts into that table the `COUNT` of all orders grouped by `ReceiveDate`.

The second `SELECT` statement displays the `COUNT` of the dates(s), during which most orders were received, as well as the `ReceiveDate` themselves. This happens by grouping the records by `ReceiveDate`. Then, only those records, which have `COUNT(*)` greater or equal to all the other records, are shown. Using `>= ALL` guarantees that only those date(s), which has/have the largest `COUNT(*)`, are being shown.

**Encountered problems**

At first, the whole procedure included this statement:

```sql
SELECT ReceiveDate, COUNT(*) as [Count of delivered orders]
	FROM Orders AS o1
	GROUP BY ReceiveDate
	HAVING COUNT(*) >= ALL (
		SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM Orders AS o2
		WHERE o1.ReceiveDate <> o2.ReceiveDate
		GROUP BY ReceiveDate)
```

> **Note:** Yes, the "`WHERE o1.ReceiveDate <> o2.ReceiveDate`" is completely redundant :D

However, this code was highly inefficient due to the fact that the subquery groups the record of `dbo.Orders` by `ReceiveDate` a lot of times, which is time consuming. That is why we changed the approach and added a temporary table (`dbo.TempOrders`), which stores the `COUNT` of all the orders grouped by `ReceiveDate`. This increases the used memory, but significantly reduces the time of the execution of the procedure (this might not be noted when having a small database such as `CouriersDB`, but the difference will be apparent when working with a lot of data).


#### 7. dbo.usp_names_of_recipients_by_order_count

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER Proc usp_names_of_recipients_by_order_count @MinOrdersCount INT
AS
BEGIN
	SELECT COUNT(RecipientID) AS [Count of orders], Name
	FROM Orders
	JOIN Recipients
	ON RecipientID = Recipients.ID
	GROUP BY Name
	HAVING COUNT(RecipientID) > @MinOrdersCount
END
```

The `SELECT` statement displays the `COUNT` of the orders and `Name` (column in `dbo.Recipients`). Those orders are grouped by `Name` (column in `dbo.Recipients`). Then, only the records with `COUNT` greater that `@MinOrdersCount` are shown.

> **Note:** `@MinOrdersCount` (`INT`) + 1 is the minimum amount of orders that a recipient must receive in order to be displayed when `usp_names_of_recipients_by_order_count` is executed

#### 8. dbo.usp_orders_count_by_order_date

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER Proc usp_orders_count_by_order_date
AS
BEGIN
	SELECT COUNT(*) AS [Count of Orders], OrderDate
	FROM Orders
	GROUP BY OrderDate
END
```

The `SELECT` statement displays the `COUNT` of the orders, grouped by `OrderDate`, as well as the `OrderDate`.

#### 9. dbo.usp_orders_profit_by_tos

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER Proc usp_orders_profit_by_tos
AS
BEGIN
	SELECT FORMAT(SUM(Total), 'C', 'bg-BG') AS [Profit], Type
	FROM Orders
	JOIN TypesOfService
	ON Orders.TypeID = TypesOfService.ID
	GROUP BY Type
END
```

The `SELECT` statement displays the `Type` and the `SUM` of the totals of the orders, grouped by `Type` (column in `dbo.TypesOfService`).

> **Note:** The function `FORMAT` is used to display the `SUM` in BGN[^bgn].

#### 10. dbo.usp_name_phonenumber_category

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER Proc usp_name_phonenumber_category
AS
BEGIN
	SELECT Name, PhoneNumber, 'Courier' AS [Category]
	FROM Couriers
	UNION
	SELECT Name, PhoneNumber, 'Client'
	FROM Clients
	UNION
	SELECT Name, PhoneNumber, 'Dispatcher'
	FROM Dispatchers
END
```

The `SELECT` statement displays `Name`, `PhoneNumber`, and `Category`. The data is fetched from the union of three tables (`dbo.Courier`, `dbo.Client`, and `dbo.Dispatcher`).

### Delete Procedures

The delete procedures are divided into two types:

1. Delete procedures that alter a specific parent table and the `FOREIGN KEY` in `dbo.Orders`, which is linked to that parent table.
2. Delete procedure which removes a record from `dbo.Orders` by a given `OldID`.

>**Note**: You can find more information about the two types in the [**Usage section**](#usage)

> **Note:** In the following subheading (`Delete Procedures`) of **`Development`** there is going to be an explanation about how the delete procedures work (`dbo.delete_couriers` is the example delete procedure used below).

Both type-1 and type-2 delete procedures delete a row from the specific table where the `ID` of that table equals to `@OldID`:

```sql
DELETE FROM Couriers
WHERE ID = @OldID;
```

The type-1 delete procedures are writen in a way, which covers 5 different scenarios:

**1. When the user enters an invalid `@OldID`**

```sql
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Couriers WHERE ID = @OldID)
BEGIN
	PRINT 'No such courier exists';
	RETURN
END;
```

The code snippet above checks whether there is a record in `dbo.Couriers` which has an `ID` = `@OldID` and if there isn't one, a 'No such courier exists' is printed. This is the second similarity between type-1 and type-2 delete procedures as in `dbo.delete_orders` (Type 2 delete procedure) there is a similar statement as the one above.

**2. When the user enters a valid `@OldID`**

```sql
IF (@WantToDeleteFromOrders = 1)
BEGIN
	DELETE FROM Orders
	WHERE courierID = @OldID;
END;
```

The code fragment above checks whether the user wants to delete the records from `dbo.Orders` where the `courierID` (a `FOREIGN KEY` linked to `dbo.Couriers`) is equal to `@OldID` (`@WantToDeleteFromOrders` = 1) **OR** `UPDATE` `dbo.Orders` by setting a new value to `courierID` (`@WantToDeleteFromOrders` = 0). `WantToDeleteFromOrders` is set to 1 (`DELETE`) by default. So, when the user enters only `@OldID`, the code bit above will be executed.

**3. When the user enters `OldID`, `WantToDeleteFromOrders`, and a valid `NewID`**

```sql
ELSE IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Couriers WHERE ID = @NewID)
		UPDATE Orders
		SET courierID = @NewID
		WHERE courierID = @OldID;
```

In this case, the procedure will `UPDATE` the records from `dbo.Orders` where `courierID` = `@OldID` and set `courierID` = `NewID`.

**4. When the user enters `OldID` and `WantToDeleteFromOrders` = 0 *OR* the user enters @OldID, @WantToDeleteFromOrders, and an invalid @NewID**

```sql
ELSE
BEGIN
	SET @NewID = NULL;

	UPDATE Orders
	SET courierID = NULL
	WHERE courierID = @OldID;
END;
```

In this case, the last part of the `IF...ELSE` block is executed due to the fact that `@NewID` is `NULL` (by `DEFAULT`) or invalid (there is no row in `dbo.Couriers` with `ID` = `@NewID`). In both scenarios the `ELSE IF` statement cannot to be true, which leads the execution of the procedure to the `ELSE` above.

The `SET` ensures that `@NewID` will leave the `ELSE` block as `NULL`. That is done to ensure that the messages at the end of the procedure are going to be accurate:

```sql
IF (@WantToDeleteFromOrders = 1)
		PRINT 'Deleted rows from Orders with courierID = ' + CAST(@OldID AS VARCHAR);
ELSE
	PRINT 'Updated row(s) in Orders with courierID = ' + CAST(@OldID AS VARCHAR) + ' by setting courierID = ' + IIF(@NewID IS NULL, 'NULL', CAST(@NewID AS VARCHAR));
```

### Conclusion
In the end, the project turned out well, even though there were some inconveniences and miscommunications. The team started off thinking it wouldn't take long to finish but it ended up taking the full two weeks we were given by higher-ups.
